# Temperance

__A Lightweight WordPress Starter Theme__

Temperance is a virtue. It's about doing enough without doing too much. In a
word - moderation. Temperance provides a solid, modern foundation, without
getting in your way. Temperance is a WordPress starter theme, built using
accessible HTML5 markup, with progressive enhancement in mind. Because
accessibility is essential for a modern, open web, Temperance strives to be
accessible by design. Use the latest version of Temperance when creating a new
WordPress theme.

better and more accessible? Just create a pull request. I'm open to
contributions. :)

## Getting Started

Everything in this theme is meant be the changed - even the function names.
Replace `temperance` in your function names with `yourname` where `yourname`
represents your desired name. 

Review the [theme checklist](docs/checklist.md) for required and optional
things to do when developing a theme. If you are going to post your theme on
the WordPress theme repository, there are additional steps that you'll need to
do.
