# Temperance
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme__

Temperance was forked recently from temperance It's still built using HTML5 & has a 
strong semantic foundation. However, I'm planning to add some accessibility 
features so that you can have an accessible WordPress starter theme. The name 
Temperance was chosen as homage to Machado's temperance project as well as TV's 
forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan. It's important to me that this 
provides enough to help you, without getting in your way. It's constantly 
growing so be sure to check back often if you are a frequent user. I'm always 
open to contribution. :)
