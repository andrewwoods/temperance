# Temperance
__A Lightweight WordPress Starter Theme__

Temperance is a virtue. It's about doing enough without doing too much. In a
word - moderation. Temperance provides a solid, modern foundation, without
getting in your way. Temperance is a WordPress starter theme.  Temperance is
built using HTML5, with strong semantic markup, and progressive enhancement in
mind. Because accessibility is essential for a modern, open web, Temperance
strives to be accessible by design. It's best to use Temperance when creating
a new WordPress theme.

Check back often to get the latest improvements. Want to help make Temperance
better and more accessible? Just create a pull request. I'm open to
contributions. :)
