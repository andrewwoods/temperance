# Temperance

__A Lightweight WordPress Starter Theme__

Temperance is a virtue. It's about doing enough without doing too much. In a
word - moderation. Temperance provides a solid, modern foundation, without
getting in your way. Temperance is a WordPress starter theme, built using
accessible HTML5 markup, with progressive enhancement in mind. Because
accessibility is essential for a modern, open web, Temperance strives to be
accessible by design. Use the latest version of Temperance when creating a new
WordPress theme.
