# Temperance
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme__

Temperance was forked recently from Bones. It's still built using HTML5 & has a
strong semantic foundation. However, I've added some accessibility features
with more to come. It's my hope that Bones will become a widely used accessible
WordPress starter theme. The name Temperance was chosen as homage to Machado's
Bones project as well as TV's forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan. It's
a favorite show of mine.  Also, Temperance is a virtue. It's important to me
that this provides enough to help you, without getting in your way. It's
constantly growing, so be sure to check back often, if you are a frequent user.
I'm always open to contributions. :)
