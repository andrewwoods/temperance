# Temperance
__A Lightweight Wordpress Starter Theme__

Temperance is a WordPress starter theme. Theme frameworks are usually either
too heavy or too rigid. Temperance is built using HTML5, with a strong semantic
foundation. Because accessibility is essential for the modern web, Temperance
strives to be accessibile by design. It's best to use Temperance when creating a new
WordPress theme. The name Temperance was chosen as homage to the Bones starter
theme project, as well as TV's forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.
Also, Temperance is a virtue. It's about doing enough without doing too much.
Temperance provides a solid, modern foundation, without doing too much or
getting in your way.

better and more accessible? Just create a pull request. I'm open to contributions. :)
