__The project tagline is cool and witty__

This is where you write a paragrah or so describing your project to the person
reading it knows what your project is all about. You could skip this part but
after all the hard work you put into creating your project, it would be a shame
if nobody ever used it, because you didn't take the time to explain it to them.
You don't have to write a lot - just enough to get them interested.
