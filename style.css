MAKE SURE TO READ BELOW BEFORE GETTING STARTED FOR THE FIRST TIME!
------------------------------------------------------------------

Temperance is a starter theme. It provides you with all the common files you need to start building a custom WordPress theme. It's designed for you to modify every file. Temperance uses Sass by default. If you prefer using regular CSS, then feel free to fork this project and keep a copy as your own personal starting point.

Here are a couple of articles on using Sass in your Themes

* http://bit.ly/TUPM5q  Introduction to Sass for New WordPress Theme Designers


That being said, here are a few MUST HAVE TOOLS for working with a
pre-processor: (You really only need one of them)

* CodeKit: (Highly Recommended) http://incident57.com/codekit/
* Compass App: (Windows / Mac Users) http://compass.handlino.com/
* Grunt: http://gruntjs.com/

These applications compile Sass into valid CSS. This way you can keep your
production files easy to read and your CSS minified and speedy. Simply set the
output to the library/css folder and you are all set. It's a thing of beauty.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, once you download Temperance it's up to you how to use it, so go
nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for you. If Sass is
still a bit confusing for you, then remove them and customize this template as
you see fit.

If you're frustrated with this new direction and don't like change, take a few
minutes and think about how much better a developer you can become by just
TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at first but it WILL make you a
better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give it a week, maybe two, and you will
never go back.

Happy Developing!
